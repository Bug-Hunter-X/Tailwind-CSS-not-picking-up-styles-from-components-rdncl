# Tailwind CSS Not Picking Up Styles from Components

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS: styles not being picked up from components.

## Bug Description

The issue is related to an incorrect `content` setting in the Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.cjs`). The paths specified in the `content` array don't accurately include all the files containing Tailwind CSS classes.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`. 
4. Observe that the styles are not applied correctly to the components.

## Bug Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing and correcting the `content` setting in `tailwind.config.js` to include all the relevant source files containing Tailwind CSS classes.  This is often an issue when using a monorepo, or a complex project structure. It is best to ensure you are using glob patterns that are broad enough to capture all the necessary files.

## How to Fix

The correct configuration should dynamically find all the files, and a good solution for this case includes using the `glob` pattern from the solution file.
